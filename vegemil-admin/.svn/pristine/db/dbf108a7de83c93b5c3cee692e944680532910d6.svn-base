        As we all know, Laravel 8 comes with Jetstream for Authentication instead of Laravel UI. But it has few
        requirements to be met.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Jetstream is designed using Tailwind CSS.</li>
        <li>Offers your choice of Livewire or Inertia scaffolding.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        We have opted for Laravel UI as our template is designed based on bootstrap CSS framework and Laravel UI
        supports bootstrap CSS. Also, we do not offer any scaffolding for Livewire or Inertia which is the base for
        using Jetstream.
      </p>

      <p>
        One can always install Jetstream and remove Laravel UI from their project but it will be custom work on their
        end. Follow <a href="https://jetstream.laravel.com/1.x/introduction.html">Jetstream</a> documentation to get
        started with it.
